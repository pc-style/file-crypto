# Synthetic Corporate Dataset

This directory was generated with the `testdata` utility that ships with File Crypto.
It mimics a mid-sized company's document share with realistic file names, content,
and directory layout so that encryption and recovery workflows can be rehearsed
without touching production data.

## Structure
- Documents/Reports: Quarterly briefings, board updates (DOCX/PDF)
- Documents/Policies: Employee handbooks and compliance addenda (RTF)
- Documents/Notes: Meeting notes and retrospectives (TXT/MD)
